Passionate Software Engineer with more than 10 years of professional experience,
engaged in the Open Source community and wireless technology for the past 15 years.
My coding journey began in 2013, and since then, I've relentlessly pursued knowledge and growth.
I started on my full-time professional career in 2014.Over the past 10+ years, I've been immersed
in diverse domains, ranging from B2B/B2C Marketplaces and E-commerce to Social Commerce, Food-Tech,
FinTech, Supply Chain, Logistics/3PL, Messaging/XMPP,SaaS, PaaS, and more.

My profile is purely technical, driven by a profound interest in scaling and automating businesses.
Throughout my career, I've taken on leadership roles as CTO, Engineering Manager, Lead, or Tech-Lead, successfully built and led engineering teams of various sizes.

My expertise lies in Backend development, focusing on solution design, architecture, and efficiently managing high-throughput, scalable infrastructures. I'm particularly enthusiastic about performance optimizations, cutting-edge technologies, and crafting clean APIs and architectures with a strong emphasis on minimalism, modularity, and reusability.
I possess more than 8 years of hands-on experience with Node.Js and expertise in Python.
I'm also familiar with Erlang and currently exploring Golang.
In terms of cloud platforms, I prefer AWS, but I also have experience with Azure. I'm well-versed in DevOps tools such as K8s, Docker, CI/CD, and more.

I've won [Champion title in the people's choice category](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live/projects/agro-skylab-durbar) with my team at [NASA Space Apps Challenge Bangladesh in 2016](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live/projects/agro-skylab-durbar) and been **CTO and TechLead** of two start-up where joined as foudning Engineer and scaled to one of the largest (100+ resources) engineering teams in country.
Currently, I hold the position of **Lead Engineer & Solution Architect** at [Comera](https://mycomera.com) local market oriented app competitor of Whatsapp and Telegram in UAE, where I oversee the XMPP-Messaging segment and lead the Sustenance Team. Additionally, I work as a part-time freelance developer, consultant, and auditor. 
In my leisure time, I love to travel, or dedicating my efforts to personal side projects that enable me to enhance my skills and experiment with cutting-edge technologies.

## Academic experience

I have successfully earned a **Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering**, completing a four-year program with a final CGPA of 3.77. 
> During my studies, I found great satisfaction in courses such as Computer Fundamentals, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms, Data Structures, Computer Operating Systems and Architecture, Database Concepts, Advanced Database Systems, Compiler Design, Project Management, and Business Communication, among others.

I started my Ph.D., but currently is on-hold. My PhD thesis was *Co-focal
microscope techniques applied to neurology*, where I was compositing
multi-gigabyte high resolution multi-layer microscope scan images of neurons to
generate 3D models. My Ph.D. thesis director was
[Ph.D. Sofía Bayona-Beriso](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/sofia.bayona).

    > 4.10.1 Related work. JavaScript is rarely used for low-level code, the
    > most OS-like projects are **NodeOS** and OS.js. **NodeOS** uses the Linux

    > Among real life applications using the datachannel as best as they can, we
    > should definitely mention **shareit** and sharefest. Such applications
    > allow browsers to share files in the absence of any form of upload to
    > external servers, as opposed to well-known services such as Dropbox or
    > Google Drive. Both **shareit** and sharefest use an external server
    > holding and managing a connection to each peer; these connections are
    > used to accomplish all the signaling procedures between peers. Thus the
    > actual p2p communication happens during file transfers.

    **Note**: [ShareIt!](projects.md#shareit) used an external server to
    bootstrap the initial discovery and signaling with other peers, once they
    were connected to at least another peer and being part of the P2P network,
    the discovery and signaling with new peers was done directly between peers
    over the P2P network itself, leaving the connection with the external
    server as a fallback mechanims.

[Diego González](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xmunch), Founder of SciArt Lab |

> as a creative and genius mind, a geek with a lot of technical skills but also
> with engagement and passion. Jesus is that kind of guy that can launch a
> project to the top. I strongly recommend him.

[Juan Francisco Gato Luis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfcogato), Android R+D &
Singer, May 2014:

> I don't need so much words to recommend Jesús. Just one case, if you need a

>
> This afternoon we'll have a call with the client and let's see if we get their
> aproval for the testing/refactoring, I'll keep you updated. We're going to
> propose it as a critical action to be done."

> "Tell you that it has been a pleasure to count on you for this job: serious,
> decisive and accessible. My idea is to have someone to whom I can ask for
> NodeJs development and evolution of projects already done like this one from
> TVN, and I think I've found the right person. If you are still available I
> will count on you in future projects without a doubt."
