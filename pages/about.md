> As a PM what more do you need when your CTO is the the most energetic, youngest & the most talented one in the town. I had the opportunity to work with him directly and found out the unquestionable leadership ability which drives through the whole team. He can deliver and execute whenever you have a problem and most importantly he works and guide directly from freshers to leads !! Not as a CTO, as a team member he works side by side in every products with the whole team either its day or night.I am extremely lucky to have worked under him in the biggest module and he guided me at every turn , every loophole, every blocker gently. Not in the good time, but also he made his team happy at the toughest of the time. If thats not an example of leadership, I don't know if theres any. Anyone can works in the industry but not everyone is lucky enough to be on the team HE made and managed from top to bottom. I wish him my deepest regards. I will be lucky if I would be able to work with him again in the future.
