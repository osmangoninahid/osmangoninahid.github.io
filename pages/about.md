I’m a **Backend & Platform Engineering Leader** with 10+ years of experience building software from the ground up and scaling it to serve millions of users. Over the years, I’ve worked across diverse domains — including e-commerce, fintech, logistics, messaging/XMPP, and SaaS — often joining startups as a founding engineer and helping them grow into large-scale, high-performing teams.

My expertise lies in **backend architecture, distributed systems, and AI infrastructure**, with deep hands-on experience in **NodeJS** and **Python**, and growing focus on **Golang**. I’m passionate about designing **scalable, reliable systems** powered by **Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform**, and **AWS**. I care deeply about developer experience, system observability, and operational excellence.

Currently, I’m part of **Open Innovation AI (OICM)**, where I focus on **MLOps, LLMOps, and AI platform engineering** — building systems that simplify model deployment, scaling, and monitoring. Previously, I led backend architecture at [**Comera**](https://mycomera.com), a UAE-based messaging platform competing with WhatsApp and Telegram. I also earned the [**NASA Space Apps Challenge People’s Choice Award**](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live/projects/agro-skylab-durbar) in 2016 for innovation in real-time satellite data systems.

He is a great mentor with excellent combination of technical and business knowledge. His exemplary leadership kept everyone motivated not only to give their best but also to go the extra mile without any hesitation. Out of the many ideologies that I have developed from him, one of them will forever be a pillar of leadership to me and that is: "The job of a good leader isn't just about distributing tasks among the team efficiently, a good leader works alongside his team to bring out the best output as a whole."

> As a PM what more do you need when your CTO is the the most energetic, youngest & the most talented one in the town. I had the opportunity to work with him directly and found out the unquestionable leadership ability which drives through the whole team. He can deliver and execute whenever you have a problem and most importantly he works and guide directly from freshers to leads !! Not as a CTO, as a team member he works side by side in every products with the whole team either its day or night.I am extremely lucky to have worked under him in the biggest module and he guided me at every turn , every loophole, every blocker gently. Not in the good time, but also he made his team happy at the toughest of the time. If thats not an example of leadership, I don't know if theres any. Anyone can works in the industry but not everyone is lucky enough to be on the team HE made and managed from top to bottom. I wish him my deepest regards. I will be lucky if I would be able to work with him again in the future.
