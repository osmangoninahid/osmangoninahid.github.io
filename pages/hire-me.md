If you are looking for someone with **10+ yrs** of solid expericence, 6+ yrs of experience
in **leading and managing** team(s), and products/technologies I've been working on, I'm
available for hiring. I'm mainly interested on remote position (both
short and long term), but sometimes I'm open to consider on-site position, if both location and offer are interesting, and we can negotiate
the terms and conditions. You can get more info about my past work experience at
my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osmangoninahid/) or at my
[Resume](https://www.osmangoni.info/osman-resume.pdf).

## What I'm lookinng for or My ideal job (AKA *Santa's letter*)


### How could it be?

- Company has something that makes it different from the other ones,
  NOT "just another one". It can be anything, like a really interesting

  workers initiative and a lot of paid holidays.
- Makes a difference, both for my career and to make the world a better place.
- A responsability position with decision on product and company future, and
  with real posibilities to improve both of them, also in ways not directly job
  related but also oriented to work conditions and the company itself.
- Travel frequently. I'm a *travel junkie*, so although I understand the
  concerns of others, for me it's a plus, so the more the merrier. If it's for
  assistance to conferences, double score :-)

<summary markdown='span'>Expand</summary>

### ü§ù Introduction questions

#### Why should I hire you? What makes you different from other candidates?

Engineering has been my vocation since I was 13 years old, I used to fix Diesel Engine,
Mobile, Radio,Tape-Recorder, MP3 Device, Electric Lgiht, Torch Light.
I started Computer Programming since 2012, Working as computers programmer professionally
since 2014 also being involved in Open Source communities since then.
I worked on various products, technologies, and collaborated with people from different
regions around the globe. I hired, mentored, and led teams of varying sizes, 
ensuring high productivity within cross-functional dynamics. I designed, developed and
scaled high perfomant product which is serving multi-million concurrent traffic.
I got awarded with many titles across the team for my perfomance and achievements in past.
I'm proud to say that I have been able to work all my life in my true passion.

My background has provided me a lot of experience and knowledge in almost all
software engineering areas, both professionally or in side projects, so I can
be able to understand the implications of each decision at several levels (extra
costs, delays, performance issues, bandwidth usage, user experience, possible
bottlenecks...), and clearly explain the systems tradeoffs and business
implications that are derived for each one of them. I love high edge technology
and to know how everything works and what's able to do. This gives me a tendency
to put technology on its limits, sometimes unconsciosly and anothers on
purposse, by using the code or service beyond the developer original intention,
but also to find and use the most concise, specific and idiomatic way of doing
the things by using any available feature or design decision that can help to
write a clean and maintenable code, that usually leads me to find bugs and usage
corner cases. That also has lead myself to put high attention on code quality
and to develop simple and minimal APIs in all the code I develop, and to enforce
that high quality standards on others.

#### What do your think about code tests? Do you do take-home code assignements?

Short answer: **YES**.

Long answer:

I have no problems about doing technical interviews, but I would appreciate "paid
code tests" policy, take-home code assignements.
I have many Open Source code in my [Github account](https://github.com/osmangoninahid)
and my [projects portfolio](projects.md), that clearly show my capabilities and code
quality standards, and the time I spend on your code tests is money I'm not
earning on my freelance projects, or time I'm not with my friends, family or
hobbies.

If you consider that's not enough and need to check yourself my work, you can
contract me for some hours as a freelance to do an actual task in your code
base, so you can evaluate my work on first hand. 

#### Where are you located?

Mostly I'm living in United Arab Emirates (UTC+4 timezone), but I'm also frequently travelling 
around UTC+1 UTC+5.5 and UTC+6 timezones

If your question is related to adjust your salary offer to life level costs, you
can target your offer to the region of London, Great Britain for western Europe
projects, and Abu Dhabi, United Arabic Emirates for middle East and Asia based
projects.

#### Are you available to relocate?

I'm interested mostly on hybrid or remote positions. 
I can consider in-site or reloation
depending of the location, offer and facilities.

### üíª Technology

#### What's your favorite tech stack?

I don't have a fixed one and I'm flexible with the technology to be used, it
mostly depends on what one does the best fit for each project, but in general
terms, depending of what's the project scope and in order of preference, my
favorites ones are:

- **Low level**: `Erlang`
- **High level**: [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) or
  [Golang](https://go.dev/)
  or 
  [Python](https://www.python.org/), depending on the priority on each poject
  about IO performance or code readibility.
- **UI**: CLI and terminal tools, web-based technologies.
- **Frameworks**:
  - [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - [Sanic](https://sanic.dev)
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)
  - [Ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/)

#### Are you interested in learning new technologies? Which ones and why?

At this moment I'm learning about Machine Learning and AI, where I'm more
interested in Generative AI and LLM.
and I'm improving my skills with Erlang programming language.
I'm also interested on improve my knowledge about WebRTC, Video
streaming and Network protocols.

I'm a hands-on learner and a bit obssesed with technical details, so if I get
some interesting project between my hands or find something that I think can be
fixed or improved, I don't have problems learning new skills or knowledge that
can be useful to me to do it, specially if they are stablished and future-proof
industrial standards and not just some temporally fashioned or hyped libraries
and frameworks.

### üèÜ Achievements

#### What's the technical challenge you are most proud of?

We encountered an overwhelming demand during our promotion, receiving **millions** of requests
and processing over **300** orders per minute. 
This surge in activity strained our system's performance and incurred significant 
costs in infrastructure and human resources required to operate and sustain the campaign.

I've designed and developed (along with team) a dynamic campaign module to launch a campaign
within short period of time (~30min) and handle large amount of traffic (e.g 1 million/min) smoothly. 
Through fine-tuning both the database and code, we significantly enhanced performance, leading to a 
**40%** decrease in overall cloud cost and an **80%** reduction in human resource costs.

You can find more info about this and other projects I've worked on and that I'm
proud of, both mine or from others, in the [projects](projects.md) page.

#### Could you share some numbers about the projects you've worked on? e.g.: users, requests, downloads, etc

- Champion (People's choice) of [NASA Space Apps Challenge Bangladesh in 2016](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live/projects/agro-skylab-durbar)
- Co-founded and developed a very well-known open-source sentence based 
  easy "Bangla Programming Language" for kids and beginners named [Potaka();](https://potaka.io)
- Developed, deployed and scaled a nationwide tech eco-system for over **7 million** users, **2 million**
  app downloads and managing more than 1 million concurrent requests.
- [Currently](https://mycomera.com) Crafting and expanding solutions for **4+ million** users
   to ensure a smooth XMPP connection.
- CTO of [Evaly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bd.com.evaly.evalyshop)

### üë® Personal questions

#### Tell me about a real life, non-technical hack you've done

[Pendrive with 10TK](https://www.facebook.com/evaly.com.bd/posts/2562362547159790) Evaly introduced an aggressive offer: a 16GB pendrive priced at 10 BDT for the first 20,000 users who placed their orders promptly. 

Within just 10 minutes and 57 seconds of launching the deal, all 20,000 orders were filled.

Given the business's heavy presence on social media, primarily Facebook,
where about 90% of customers were connected, doubts arose swiftly. 
People began casting suspicion, alleging the promotion was a fraudulent marketing ploy. 
The speed at which 20,000 orders were claimed seemed implausible, prompting a wave of negative
comments and reactions across social media channels immediately after the deal concluded.

We endeavored to find a solution to reassure them that 20,000 orders had indeed been filled.
The commercial, customer experience, and management teams worked tirelessly to calm the situation,
halt negative reactions, and convey the truth.

Ultimately, the team(s) proposed a solution: posting the list of 20,000 order invoices on social media
to demonstrate their authenticity. However, there were concerns that some might still doubt 
the legitimacy of these invoices.

I suggested a resolution: urging successfully ordered individuals to comment with their invoice numbers
under a post. We specified that orders would be delivered based on the sequence of comments, 
following a first-come, first-served (FIFO) basis.

Upon making this announcement, we received over 9,000 comments within the initial 5 minutes. 
The uproar transformed into silence, accompanied by positive reactions from the audience.


#### What are your hobbies outside of work?

Outside of work, I like travelling, hanging out with friends, listening music,
reading and watching cricket and football matches.


#### If you could be able to organize an intelectual dinner, what three people (live or dead) would you invite?

The two first ones would be
[Muhammad Yunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus) and 
[Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)

Third one would be a bit more difficult to choose between <br/>
[Mohammad Rassel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadrassel/) (one of the most brilliant master-minds I've ever meet)<br/>
and
[Jack Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ma) 
 or
[Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs).<br/>
That would make four and no three persons, but being there all of us 5, that would be a really
interesting dinner and maybe new projects or new ideas would appear there.


### üè¢ Company culture

#### What types of companies have you worked in? e.g.: startups, consulting, enterprise, agencies, etc

I've worked for one stablished enterprises like
[Grameephone](https://www.grameenphone.com/) as part-time consultant, and a couple of times for consulting
firms or freelance agencies, but the ones I've worked more times and enjoyed the
most has always been freelance projects on my own and startups.

#### What type of company would you like to work for and why?

I like to work on startup companies, or in a startup-like minded team, since
they are the most creative and dynamic ones. I would like to work on research &
development or on a company that has its own product, and a company that's
mostly focused on the quality of their product and service over any other aspect,
instead of being directed by sales department or any predefined deadlines.


#### Do you prefer to work alone, or as part of a group?

I like to work in a group, specially on small ones, the cross-functional one
focused on a single project where there's a clear roadmap on what to do, 
or where technical expertise of co-workers is high and everybody is trying to do their best.
This open the door to the posibility of discuss the different approachs to the problems and learn
ones from the others.

#### Do you currently have a job? What do you like and dislike about it?

Currently I'm working as *Lead Engineer & Solution Architect* for [Comera](https://www.mycomera.com/) as
my main job and as part-time freelance developer, consultor and auditor. In that
way, I'm always actively looking for freelance projects to work on remote in my
spare time (maybe yours! :-D ).


#### If I made you an offer, what would make you to reject it?

If we get up to this point, probably I would have already consider the pros &
cons regarding changing my current job, so only I would reject a job offer if
the tasks I would be involved are not motivational enought, or the final salary
difference with my current job would not compensate the change.
