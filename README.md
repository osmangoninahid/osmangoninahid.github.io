# Osman Goni Nahid

## What I'm looking for?
I want to travel, I want to work and travel at the same time, working 100% remotely.

I prefer to work with people that love the product we are creating, putting a lot of effort to improve what we are creating. People that really love coding.I believe I am capable to accept new challenges and meet my employer expectation who likes the Unix environment for development.

I learn fast, early adopt and continuously explore with innovation.

Flexible hours and flexible days will be a must. I want to manage my own schedule.

As you can see, this is a "perfect job". Meaning, you can offer something that do not full fill this points. We can negotiate it.

> Note: I want to continue working in NodeJS & Django. I prefer Backend, but frontend using ReactJS could be a good option and Mobile application with native or React-Native could be a fun. Also have some familiarity and interest with DevOps stuffs.

## A bit of my history
From 2013 I started Software Engineering bachelor course at [University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/), During University life I put a lot of time in competitive programming (ACM ICPC) during my university life and participated 10+ National programming contest. And started learning Android Mobile Application development besides study. Fortunately, I got a Job offer in middle of my University-life from a local company to join as Android Application Developer then started there...

From 2014 to 2016 I always worked in personal (and job) projects using always the same technologies (creating and setting up absolutely everything on my own).
* Linux(Ubuntu)
* GIT
* Android (Java,XML)
* C/C++/Python (Problem Solving/Contest)
* SQLite, MySQL

Then, I left my happy Mobile-Apps-Dev-life and I started working using another stack:
* Ubuntu server (setting it up using Vagrant)
* GIT
* Apache
* Nginx
* PHP (Slim , Laravel & Raw)
* Unity3D (Little bit)

This stack was super productive for me until mid 2016, moment where I got opportunity to work on NodeJS, ReactJS, Django, AWS and Firebase. So now, my stack for personal projects has this shape:
* NodeJS/Express (Backend)
* Python/Django (Backend)
* AWS
* Azure
* Microservice
* GIT
* Firebase Hosting for static serving
* Firebase Functions and Firebase Database for no-sql database and backend (creating some kind of REST API in Firebase Functions)
* React (+JSX) + Redux + Thunks + Reselect as frontend

^ This is my current Stack. REST API, frontend with React and Backend using Django and/or Express + SQL + NoSQL & Non-Relational-DB (like Postgres, Mongo). Full ECMAScript stack.


## Companies where I worked?
* Home. The best place to improve knowledge randomly. I'm always working in personal projects to improve knowledge in different technologies.
* Power GP BD Ltd. ~1.2 years working as Android developer, doing mobile application stuffs. (It's kind of outsource based software factory)
* RITL. few month worked as Software Engineer (SQL, PHP, Slim, JavaScript, Unity3D). Game development & Backend.
* Local Insights. few month remotely worked as Lead Full Stack Engineer (NodeJS, Django, ReactJS, JavaScript). Cloud Data service provider company.
* Inovio Inc. ~1.3 years. Huge public software company cloud platform based service provider. Full Stack Developer (NodeJS, Python/Django, ReactJS). Working at Disney projects.
* Ekkbaz. Currently working here. Startup based on Singapore. Working as Senior Software Engineer (NodeJS, React-Native and ReactJS sometimes Python), mostly working in the Backend team. Collaborating on (Frontend) ReactJS & React-Native team.

So, as you can see, I worked at Huge public company and Startups.
